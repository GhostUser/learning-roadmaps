# Learning Javascript roadmap

This is a roadmap for new-to-programming users who want to learn Javascript.

## Learning the language and syntax

1. [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)

    To start with, you need to learn the language and it's features (aka, _syntax_). Codeacademy has an amazingly simple model for helping new-to-programming students learn programming, or at a minimum gaining exposure to programming. Unfortunately, much of their content has changed to be paywalled.

    Complete the JavaScript course within a short timeframe--preferably in a week. If you do not use the information, you will most likely forget it, so doing it within a reasonable amount of time will help you not forget key lessons causing you to need to start over.

2.  [FreeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map#nested-collapseBasicJavaScript)
    Use the list of javascript items to pave your way to the next step. You can either go through FreeCodeCamp, or just use this list and google for blog articles on each topic. Some may be too simple to merit a blog, in which you should find them on [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). See item 5, below.
    
3. Refer to [javascript-fundementals](./javascript-fundamentals.md) as a checklist before proceeding.

4. Make something in codepen / jsfiddle

    This step is for your own cognisance. Try, and potentially fail, to build something. This will tell you what you do know, and where you need help.

5. Reference [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for help with syntax, methods, and more.

    MDN should be your first resource for looking up capabilities, method names, and other facets of javascript.
    As an example of what to google: "mdn array forEach" to look up the `forEach` method of arrays.

6. Repeatedly challenge yourself via [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)

    This step is to incorporate fun, but challanging, problems into your learning process.
Kata's scale fairly well with your skill, but also provide you insight into computer science problems.

    - Try to give each kata a solid attempt without searching for solutions. Again, **cognisance is important**, especially for rapid and intentional learning.


7. Build a Project

    This is when you should have been thinking of something that wouid be neat to build, or that *you want to build* and give it your first go. Don't choose something too lofty like a game, or an entire application. It's on you to be practical. I suggest aiming to work on a project that will take you less than a week to complete the initial code portion (you can go back to cleanup if needed).

### Tools for learning

1. [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) for quickly prototyping things. [JSfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/) works just-as-well.
2. [CodeSandbox.io](CodeSandbox.io) For a more-involved version of codepen.io, with built in frameworks.
