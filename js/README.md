# Learning Javascript roadmap

This is a roadmap for new-to-programming users who want to learn Javascript.

## Learning the language and syntax

1. [Understand the ecosystem you're learning, and how JS fits into it](https://atom-morgan.github.io/what-is-web-development/)

2. [Learn JavaScript / Web Development on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

    To start with, you need to learn the language and it's features (aka, _syntax_). The language is the tool that will allow you to create things. It's suggested you do all parts of the [Learn Web Development on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) as understanding web development will help you immensely if you plan to use JavaScript in the browser. It will teach you how JavaScript fits into the web.

    
3. Refer to [javascript-fundementals](./javascript-fundamentals.md) as a checklist before proceeding.

4. Make something in codepen / jsfiddle

    This step is for your own cognisance. Try, and potentially fail, to build something. This will tell you what you do know, and where you need help.

5. Reference [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for help with syntax, methods, and more.

    MDN should be your first resource for looking up capabilities, method names, and other facets of javascript.
    As an example of what to google: "mdn array forEach" to look up the [`forEach` method of arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach).

6. Repeatedly challenge yourself via [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)

    This step is to incorporate fun, but challanging, problems into your learning process.
Kata's scale fairly well with your skill, but also provide you insight into computer science problems.

    - Try to give each kata a solid attempt without searching for solutions. Again, **cognisance is important**, especially for rapid and intentional learning.


7. Build a Project

    This is when you should have been thinking of something that wouid be neat to build, or that *you want to build* and give it your first go. Don't choose something too lofty like a game, or an entire application. It's on you to be practical. I suggest aiming to work on a project that will take you less than a week to complete the initial code portion (you can go back to cleanup if needed).

8. You will note that this list isn't fully comprehensive of all of JS. This is only a list to get you far enough until your own interest and desire to _build things_ takes off. At that point, you should be self-motivated, and at least know the questions to ask to propel your own learning.


### Tools for learning

1. [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) for quickly prototyping things. [JSfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/) works just-as-well.
1. [CodeSandbox.io](CodeSandbox.io) For a more-involved version of codepen.io, with built in frameworks.
1. [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) Code challenges based on mathematical problems. They start easy enough and ramp up.
