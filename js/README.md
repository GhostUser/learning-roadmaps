# Learning Javascript roadmap

This is a roadmap for new-to-programming users who want to learn Javascript.

## Learning the language and syntax

1. [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)

    To start with, you need to learn the language and it's features (aka, _syntax_). Codeacademy has an amazingly simple model for helping new-to-programming students learn programming, or at a minimum gaining exposure to programming.

    Try to complete the entire codeacademy javascript course within a month. If you do not use the information, you will most likely forget it, so doing it within a reasonable amount of time will help you not forget key lessons causing you to need to start over.

2. Make something in codepen / jsfiddle

    This step is for your own cognisance. Try, and potentially fail, to build something. This will tell you what you do know, and where you need help.

3. Reference [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for help with syntax, methods, and more.

    MDN should be your first resource for looking up capabilities, method names, and other facets of javascript.

4. Repeatedly challenge yourself via [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com)

    This step is to incorporate fun, but challanging, problems into your learning process.
Kata's scale fairly well with your skill, but also provide you insight into computer science problems.

    - Try to give each kata a solid attempt without searching for solutions. Again, **cognisance is important**, especially for rapid and intentional learning.


5. Build a Project

    This is when you should havve been thinking of something that wouid be neat to build, or that *you want to build* and give it your first go. Don't choose something too lofty like a game, or an entire application. It's on you to be practical. I suggest aiming to work on a project that will take you less than a week to complete the initial code portion (you can go back to cleanup if needed).

### Tools for learning

1. [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) for quickly prototyping things. [JSfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/) works just-as-well.
